    <h2>Kimchi-jjigae (Kimchi stew)</h2>

    <p>Kimchi stew is one of the most common and loved dishes in Korean cuisine.
        Not to be confused with the thinner Kimchi Soup, this stew is a thick and spicy 
        concoction typically consisting traditionally of aged kimchi, onion, thinly sliced pork belly, and seasonings.
        Some variations can include a different type of protein, such as cod and other types of whitefish or canned tuna</p>

    <p>Traditionally a communal meal, this stew is often served family style in a large pot to be shared with between all diners. 
        It is often at least a typical side dish in most Korean style meals.</p>
